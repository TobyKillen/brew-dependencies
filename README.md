# My Personal Local Development Configuration

This repo stores my Homebrew setup in a version-controlled `Brewfile` so I can easily recreate my local dev environment.  
Run `brew bundle dump` to save my current packages.  
Clone this repo and run `brew bundle` to restore everything on a new machine.  
Keeps my tools, apps, and configuration consistent across macOS installs.
